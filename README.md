# 🛒 Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from [Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/) — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

This project is perfect for:
- 📊 Data Analyst aspirants who want to build a strong **Portfolio Project** for interviews and LinkedIn
- 📚 Anyone learning SQL hands-on
- 💼 Preparing for interviews in retail, e-commerce, or product analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL:

✅ Clean and prepare messy real-world inventory data  
✅ Write business-driven SQL queries in PostgreSQL  
✅ Understand product pricing, discounts, and stock strategy  
✅ Identify high-value and out-of-stock products  
✅ Derive insights around **pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue** and more.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:
- **sku_id:** Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

- **name:** Product name as it appears on the app

- **category:** Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

- **mrp:** Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

- **discountPercent:** Discount applied on MRP

- **discountedSellingPrice:** Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

- **availableQuantity:** Units available in inventory

- **weightInGms:** Product weight in grams

- **outOfStock:** Boolean flag indicating stock availability

- **quantity:** Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)
